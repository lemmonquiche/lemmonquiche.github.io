#### About me

I am a second year PhD student at University of California Berkeley in the <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/">Computational Biology Graduate Group</a>. I am advised by <a href="http://www.nielsenlab.org/">Rasmus Nielsen</a> of the Departments of Integrative Biology and Statistics.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in integrating ecological methods with population genetics to understand how species respond to environmental changes. Currently I am working on developing methods for population genetic analyses of environmental DNA.

#### Background
I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in December 2018 with a degree in computer science and minors in bioengineering and chemistry. There I did research with <a href="https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/IpsitaBanerjee/">Ipsita Banerjee</a> (2016), <a href="https://www.kostkalab.net/">Dennis Kostka</a> (2018), and at the <a href="https://db.cs.pitt.edu/group/">Advanced Data Management Technologies Laboratory</a> supervised by <a href="https://labrinidis.cs.pitt.edu/">Alexandros Labrinidis</a> (2018-2019). I also participated in <a href="http://2016.igem.org/Team:Pittsburgh">iGEM</a> (2016-2017) as a student leader and then a student advisor the following <a href="http://2017.igem.org/Team:Pittsburgh">year</a>. Along with my academic work, I've held two internships with Bayer Crop Science as a Genotyping Development Scientist Intern (2018) and as a Data Engineering Intern (2019).

When I'm not working you can find me climbing, hiking, baking, or playing DnD. But probably not all at once.
