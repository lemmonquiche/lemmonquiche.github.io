#### About me

I am a second year PhD student at University of California Berkeley in the <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/">Computational Biology Graduate Group</a>. I am advised by <a href="http://www.nielsenlab.org/">Rasmus Nielsen</a> of the Departments of Integrative Biology and Statistics.

<!-- I'm interested in how genetics relate to variation and evolution of complex traits; in particular, how adaptation and natural selection have shaped who we are today (i.e., modern human phenotypic and genetic variation). My work draws on a combination of population and statistical genetics, and is broadly focused on using DNA sequence data and/or GWAS to build methods to study adaptation and complex trait evolution.  

Some of my specific research interests are:
<ul>
	<li> Detecting natural selection, from alleles to complex traits </li>
	<li> Disentangling selection on pleiotropically-related traits </li> 
	<li> The role of ancestry in heritable trait variation </li>
	<li> Stratification in GWAS, and its implications for downstream analysis (e.g. tests for selection) </li>
</ul> -->

#### Background
I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in December 2018 with a degree in computer science and minors in bioengineering and chemistry. There I did research with <a href="https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/IpsitaBanerjee/">Ipsita Banerjee</a> (2016),<a href="https://www.kostkalab.net/">Dennis Kostka</a> (2018), and at the <a href="https://db.cs.pitt.edu/group/">Advanced Data Management Technologies Laboratory</a> supervised by <a href="https://labrinidis.cs.pitt.edu/">Alexandros Labrinidis</a> (2018-2019). I also participated in <a href="http://2016.igem.org/Team:Pittsburgh">iGEM</a> (2016-2017) as a student leader and then a student advisor the following <a href="http://2017.igem.org/Team:Pittsburgh">year</a>. Along with my academic work, I've held two internships with Bayer Crop Science as a Genotyping Development Scientist Intern (2018) and as a Data Engineering Intern (2019).

When I'm not working you can find me climbing, hiking, baking, or playing DnD. But probably not all at once.
