#### About me

I am a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in the <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/">Graduate Group in Computational Biology</a> advised by <a href="http://www.nielsenlab.org/">Rasmus Nielsen</a> of the Depts. of Integrative Biology and Statistics. I also work with <a href="http://zaitlenlab.science/">Noah Zaitlen</a> at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine.

I'm interested in how genetics relate to variation and evolution of complex traits; in particular, how adaptation and natural selection have shaped who we are today (i.e., modern human phenotypic and genetic variation). My work draws on a combination of population and statistical genetics, and is broadly focused on using DNA sequence data and/or GWAS to build methods to study adaptation and complex trait evolution.  

Some of my specific research interests are:
<ul>
	<li> Detecting natural selection, from alleles to complex traits </li>
	<li> Disentangling selection on pleiotropically-related traits </li> 
	<li> The role of ancestry in heritable trait variation </li>
	<li> Stratification in GWAS, and its implications for downstream analysis (e.g. tests for selection) </li>
</ul>

#### Background
In 2015 I graduated from Northwestern University, where I did my undergraduate studies with <a href="https://adamhockenberry.com/">Adam Hockenberry</a> and <a href="https://amaral.northwestern.edu/">Luís Amaral</a> at the Northwestern Institute for Complex Systems. From 2017-2018 I was a Computational Biology Fellow at AncestryDNA, where I worked with <a href="http://songsy.github.io/">Shiya Song</a> and Dan Garrigan, where I developed statistical models for inferring genealogical relationships from genetic data, and studied the recent demographic history of humans in North America.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking (especially the Sierras), playing/following basketball/the NBA, cooking, and watching The Sopranos.
