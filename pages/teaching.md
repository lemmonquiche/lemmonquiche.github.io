<li> </li>
<li> <i>Received the</i> Outstanding GSI Award <i>from the Dept.of Statistics for my instruction of Stat 135; this award is given to ~9% of UC Berkeley GSIs.</i></li>
</ul> 

#### Integrative Biology 249, Co-organizer, Fall 2020
**Statistical genetics of complex traits**
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li> This course surveys recent advances in the statistical genetics of complex traits.</li>
<li> I designed the syllabus and helped organize the course.</li>
</ul>

### Research mentorship 
I also mentor several undergraduate students:

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">

<li><b>Zaid Ahmad</b> is in his third year of undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley, majoring in math and statistics. Zaid is working on methods to combine ancient and modern DNA sequence data to detect natural selection.</li>

<li><b>Courtney Rauchman</b> undergrad at UC Berkeley, graduated with a degree in Data Science. She studied the impact of stratification and natural selection on LD-based heritability estimates.</li> 

<li><b>Yulin Zhang</b> is a senior at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China. Yulin studies the dynamics of genetic rescue and its effects on local adaptations. She is starting her PhD in Computational Biology at UC Berkeley in Fall 2021.</li>

</ul>
 
### Python bootcamp instructor

For the past two years I have instructed and TAed lectures for the Center for Computational Biology's <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/outreach/workshops-bootcamps/">Python Bootcamp</a>. Whether you are a student, researcher, or member of industry interested in learning Python programming skills, please reach out to us if you are interested in participating!

### Refereeing

I have reviewed for the following publications:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">

<li> Genetics </li>
<li> G3: Genes | Genomes | Genetics </li>
<li> Evolution Letters </li>

</ul>

### Bay Area Population Genetics

In Fall 2019 I served as lead organizer of the biannual Bay Area Population Genetics meeting, hosted on November 9, 2019 at UC Berkeley.
