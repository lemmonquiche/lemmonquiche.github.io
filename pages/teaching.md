### Research Mentorship 
At Berkeley, I mentored an undergraduate, Chris Dong, on a project to incorporate environmental variables in population structure analysis of environmental DNA and developed his skills in computational tools

As an undergraduate at the University of Pittsburgh, I was the student adviser for <a href="http://2017.igem.org/Team:Pittsburgh">Pitt iGEM 2017</a>. I supervised the team on day to day planning and experiments and helped troublshoot any problems.
