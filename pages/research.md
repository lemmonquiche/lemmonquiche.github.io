### Population Genetic Analyses for Environmental DNA

I am currently developing computationally efficient methods of population genetic analyses for environmental DNA (eDNA). During my rotation in the Nielsen lab, I implemented a pipeline to compute population genetic summary statistics for eDNA. Now I am using those results to investigate population structure from samples across California. I am also working on the first algorithm to estimate phylogentically compatible haplotypes from eDNA.

Come back for exciting future updates on the progress and results of these projects!!
